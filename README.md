Seattle Per Scholas case study 

Summary


Technical challanges
I faced many different challanges during the creation of this project, as I have never used Spring, and learning how to implement the persitance layer along with the MVC principal was quite a challange. The first challange I faced was learning how a controller handles displaying your web pages. I kept getting many 404s before I learned that proper configuration to start my project.
